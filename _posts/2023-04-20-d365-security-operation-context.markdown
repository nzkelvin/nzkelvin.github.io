# The Evolution and Significance of Roles Inherited by Team Membership in Dynamics 365

Dynamics 365, Microsoft's suite of intelligent business applications, has evolved over the years. One of the areas that has seen significant evolution is security, particularly in the context of roles inherited by team membership. In this blog post, we will take a journey through the history of roles inherited by team membership, delve into the significance of the user's operation context, and illustrate with examples.

## The History

In the early versions of Microsoft Dynamics, such as CRM 4.0 and CRM 2013, security roles assigned to teams were not inherited by team members. Instead, for a user to gain access to records owned by a team, the team had to be the owner of the records. This model was restrictive and didn't allow for flexible sharing of access permissions.

With the release of later versions, Dynamics 365 introduced enhancements to the security model, particularly concerning team membership and role inheritance. These changes enabled teams to function more like groups, where users could inherit security roles assigned to the team without the team having to own the records. This transition was a game-changer as it allowed for much more flexible and granular security configurations.

## Understanding Operation Context

In Dynamics 365, the operation context of a user is pivotal in determining the access that the user has to various records and operations. The operation context is effectively the security context under which a user is operating – as an individual or as a member of a team. This distinction is crucial because it determines what set of permissions are applied to the user’s actions.

### Team Privileges Only

If a security role is set to "Team privileges only", users do not inherit any permissions from the role through their membership in the team. Instead, the role only applies to records that are owned by the team. This means that the user's operation context is critical here.

For example, if a user named "Joe" is part of a Sales Team, and the Sales Team owns a particular record, Joe can only access the record when operating under the context of the Sales Team, not as an individual. **The key here is the owner of the record is the Sales Team.**

### Direct User (Basic) access level and Team privileges

When a security role is set to "Direct User (Basic) access level and Team privileges", users **inherit permissions from the role** both as individual users and **as team members**. In this configuration, the operation context becomes fluid, and Dynamics 365 aggregates permissions from both contexts.

For example, if Joe has individual permissions to read and update records and is also part of a team that has delete permissions, he will be able to read, update, and delete records regardless of whether he is operating as an individual or as a member of the team.

## The Significance of Operation Context

The operation context becomes significant, especially in complex organizations where users may be part of multiple teams with different levels of access to various records. By understanding the operation context, organizations can better configure their security roles to ensure that users have the appropriate level of access needed to perform their duties without exposing sensitive data unnecessarily.

## Conclusion

Understanding the evolution and significance of roles inherited by team membership in Dynamics 365 is essential for system administrators and customizers. It allows for the creation of a robust and efficient security model that can cater to the complex requirements of modern organizations. As Dynamics 365 continues to evolve, staying abreast of changes in security configurations will be paramount for maintaining secure and effective systems.
