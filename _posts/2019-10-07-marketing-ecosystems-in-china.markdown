# Cover Story: Marketing Eco-systems in China
## What are the same?
The marketing concepts are the same in China or not, for example, marketing segmentation, conversion rates, and (virtual) foot traffic.

## What are different?
However, your typical Email Direct Marketing (EDM) won't work in China because most of Chinese users don't use it.

Social media will be your friend but Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are blocked in China. Therefore in order to succeed in the Chinese market you need to familiar with the Chinese social media eco-system.

## DianPing
DianPing (点评) means review in English. It is popular for two main functions, which are geo-fencing and recommendations.

The scenarios is that Joe Blow arrives in a big shopping mall for first time. DianPing's geo-fencing search engine will tell him any interests (restaurants, cinemas, pubs and etc) near by. Joe will skim through the options, the reputations (stars), and comments left by previous visitors. 

Once decide on a resturant, Joe will use DianPing again for recommendations on dishes. Here we go. This is how DianPing can generate foot traffic for a restaurant.

Unfortunately, DianPing's customer journey often ends here. Once Joe sit down at a dining table he will close DianPing and order his dishes in person or via a WeChat mini program.

# CRM
Alibaba and SalesForce announced partnership in Auguest 2019. The detail of the partnership will come later. Microsoft Dynamics 365 online seems to be ahead of the game in the Chinese market. Their Chinese version of the Dynamics 365 online is called "moon cake", and it is on the ground and running since July 2019. Also, SalesForce lacks of an on-premise version which Microsoft has. Disclaimer: I am bias on this one.
