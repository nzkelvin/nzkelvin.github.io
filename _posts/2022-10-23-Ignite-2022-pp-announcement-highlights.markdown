## Power Pages GA
Power Pages as a standalone Power Platform product is now GA. It is a new member to a family of Power Platform products, including Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI, Power Virtual Agent. Previously, it is call Power Apps Portal.

Another important change is the Power Pages license model. It is no longer charged by the number of view. Instead, it is charged per website via monthly authenticated and anonymous users. So, I guess it will be a good choice for many 2B scenarios. For 2C scenarios, you need to consider the potential number of users and consequently the licensing cost.

>In May 2022, Microsoft Power Platform announced Power Pages as a standalone product in preview. Today, we're proud to announce that Power Pages is generally available. 
>
>As demand for custom, well-crafted business websites surges, it is increasingly difficult for IT departments and developers to write custom code for every webpage.
>
>Power Pages enables citizen developers and professional developers alike to rapidly spin up low-code, scalable, and secure business-centric websites. 
>
>For customers to focus more on website development and less on licensing, Power Pages has also simplified its business model by moving to capacity-based subscriptions and pay-as-you-go meters. 
>
>Power Pages licenses are now charged per website via monthly authenticated and anonymous users. Additionally, Power Pages has also removed the distinction between internal and external authenticated users. 
>
>These changes make it easier for organizations to choose appropriate licensing options for their website.

## Model Driven Apps Real Time Co-authoring 
This is a very welcoming feature, especially for the multi developers working on the same app scenario. Previously, we have developers lost JavaScript code work due to multiple developers working on the same script and overwrite each others work.

## Managed Environments
Managed environments in GA offers a set of OOTB governance capabilities, and built-in ALM, pipeline automation, and more. 

## Cross-tenant dataset sharing
>Cross-tenant dataset sharing enables users to share datasets with external organizations like business partners, customers, and vendors in an easy, quick, and secure manner. When the dataset is shared with external users, they can access it in their own tenant, build composite models on top of the shared dataset with their own internal data, and build and share reports based on the model. 
>
>Users can access all their external datasets in one easy-to-find place in Power BI Desktop. Along with cross-tenant dataset sharing, Power BI is making it easier to discover reports, dashboards, and workspaces shared by external tenants with you as a guest user in their tenant. Users can just go to their home page and find all content shared with them by external organizations in the “External
data” tab.
