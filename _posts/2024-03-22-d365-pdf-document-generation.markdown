* Step 1: [Use Word templates to create standardized documents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/using-word-templates-dynamics-365)
* Step 2: [Export sales records to PDF](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/sales/create-quote-pdf)


### Limitations
* Cannot cope with complex data structures and calculations
* Does not support auto-generation of documents

## Generate PDF programmatically
### Select.HtmlToPdf
[Select.HtmlToPdf](https://selectpdf.com/community-edition/) is a free .NET library that can be used to convert any web page or HTML to PDF. The community edition is free and can generate PDFs up to 5 pages long.

Here is [the Select.HtmlToPdf nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Select.HtmlToPdf/).

## Generate PDF programmatically > Build Your Own HTML to PDF Converter Library
Building a production-ready, fully-featured HTML to PDF converter from scratch is a significant undertaking. At a high level, the things you need to consider are:

Yes, I can definitely guide you through the core concepts of building a basic HTML to PDF converter from scratch in .NET. Here's an outline of the process and things to keep in mind:

**1. HTML Parsing**

* **Library:** You could use a library like AngleSharp ([https://github.com/AngleSharp/AngleSharp](https://github.com/AngleSharp/AngleSharp)) which is specifically designed for parsing HTML in .NET.
* **Parsing Process:** Load your HTML string into a parser and build a DOM (Document Object Model) tree representation.

**2. Layout Engine**

* **Challenges:** This is the most complex part. You need to calculate the positioning and dimensions of HTML elements based on CSS rules. 
* **Simplified Approach:** For a basic converter, you could start with simpler CSS rules like block-level elements, basic font styles, colors, etc.
* **Advanced Features:**  A full-fledged layout engine is quite complex and would involve handling intricate CSS like floats, complex positioning, and more.  

**3. PDF Generation**

* **Library:** Use a PDF generation library like iTextSharp ([https://itextpdf.com/en](https://itextpdf.com/en)) or similar.
* **Mapping:** Map the elements from your parsed HTML DOM and calculated layout into corresponding PDF objects (text, images, rectangles, etc.)

**Key Considerations**

* **Scope:** Building a production-ready, fully-featured HTML to PDF converter from scratch is a significant undertaking. It's better to start with a basic version and iteratively expand on its capabilities.
* **CSS Complexity:**  Fully replicating a browser's rendering behavior is extremely challenging.  You'll need to decide which subset of CSS you'll support.  
* **Tradeoffs:**  Creating your own engine offers maximum control,  but it's time-consuming. Using existing libraries often provides  a faster development path. 

**Example: Very Basic Structure (Conceptual)**

```csharp
class SimpleHtmlToPdfConverter
{
    public void Convert(string html, string outputPath)
    {
        var document = AngleSharp.Html.Parser.Default.ParseDocument(html);
        // ... (simplified layout calculation) ...

        using (var pdfDoc = new PdfDocument()) 
        {
            // Add pages to pdfDoc

            foreach (var element in document.Body.Children)
            {
                // ... (Handle different element types and map to PDF objects) ...
            }

            pdfDoc.Save(outputPath);
        }
    }
}
```
