# The Evoluction of Dynamics 365 Product Names
Dynamics 365 Online is a relatively new concept in China. I created a table to map the old product names to the new ones. I guess it will be easier to learn new knowledge from leveraging on your existing knowledge.

| Old School Names | On-premise Names | On-cloud Names | Comments |
|----------|-------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dynamics CRM   | Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement   | [Dynamics 365 Sales](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/)  |              |
| Dynamics CRM   | Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement   | Dynamics 365 Marketing  | 
| Dynamics CRM   | Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement   | Dynamics 365 Customser  |              |             |
| Dynamics CRM   | Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement   | Dynamics 365 Field Service  |              | 
| Dynamics CRM   | Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement   | Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation |              | 
|   |    | Forms Pro |    This product is for survey and getting customer feedbacks     | 
|   |    | Retail |   eCommerce     | 
| Dynamics AX   | Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations | Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management  |              | 
| Dynamics AX   | Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations | Dynamics 365 Finance  |              |
| Dynamics AX   | Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations | Dynamics 365 Retail  |              |
| Dynamics NAV  | [Dynamics 365 NAV](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-nav-app/) | [Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/nav-overview/)  | While both NAV and AX are ERP products, AX is targeting multi-national companies and NAV is aiming for mid-size enterprises           |

As you can see the two traditionally separated platforms (CRM and ERP) converged in the cloud. The Dynamics 365 Platform will be you on stop shop for all your CRM and ERP needs.
