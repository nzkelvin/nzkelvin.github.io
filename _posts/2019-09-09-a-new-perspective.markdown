Sorry guys, I haven't posted in the last four months or so. It is because I relocated myself from New Zealand to China. I am still having a base in New Zealand but my work is in China for now.

I am lucky to be an IT consultant. It allows me to continue my career even after moved 10,000+ km!

If the meaning of life is memories. The relocation definitely created a few new memories. I will share them in my future posts.

The announcement does stop here. My new blog site is up. I will blog from [http://blog.kelvinbytes.com][kelvinbytes-blogsite] from now on. PLEASE SUBSCRIBE. Don't worry I will gradutely move old posts from my [old blog site][kelvinbytes-oldblog] to the new one. So everything will be in the same place.

If you want me to cover a specific topic please request by creating [a GitHub issue][kelvinbytes-blogsite-issues].
