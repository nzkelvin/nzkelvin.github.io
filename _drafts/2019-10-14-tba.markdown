# Thoughts 
When I left New Zealand to work in China, I joked about the crazy [996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/996_working_hour_system) working schedule in China. Last week (7/Oct/2019 to 12/Oct/2019), I just had my first 996 week. It was tiring but also satisfying to see how much is achieved over just a week. I quickly realised that I have adjust my life and doing thing ever more efficient so that I can still maintain a 'normal-ish' life so I don't get burnt.
